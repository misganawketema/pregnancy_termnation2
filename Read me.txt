# Predicting termination of pregnancy among Ethiopian pregnant women using homogeneous ensemble machine learning algorithm

# Background

Between 2015 and 2019, approximately 73.3 million abortions  of which 21.6 million were unsafe abortions were performed globally, 
almost all of which occurred in developing countries. Every year, approximately 210 million women become pregnant around the world, 
with one in every ten pregnancies ending in unsafe abortion. According to the World Health Organization(WHO) there are four general 
categories of reasons for pregnancy termination, which encompass preserving the mother's health, addressing cases of rape or incest,
 preventing the birth of a child with severe abnormalities, and considering social and economic factors. 
This study aims to predict termination of pregnancy among pregnant women in the case of Ethiopia using homogeneous ensemble machine learning algorithms

# Methods

Following an experimental research approach, this study utilized data obtained from the Ethiopian Demographic Health Survey. 
The data underwent preprocessing to ensure high quality and suitability for the machine learning algorithm. 
The objective was to develop a predictive model for determining the termination of pregnancy. 
Multiple models, including Adaptive Boost, Random Forest, Cat Boost, Extra Tree, and Extreme Gradient Boosting, were employed in this endeavor.
 The dataset consisted of 23,482 instances, each containing 14 features. To evaluate the models, a training and testing dataset split ratio of 80/20 was utilized.
#Result 
The overall accuracy of random forest, cat boost, extreme gradient boosting, extra tree and adaptive boost is 90.59%, 89.92%, 89.80%, 89.04, and 89.50%  respectively.

# Conclusion

After careful evaluation, the researchers opted to employ random forest algorithms for advancing risk factor analysis and rule generation.
 This decision was made based on the algorithm's impressive performance, achieving an accuracy rate of 90.59%. By utilizing the concept of feature importance, 
the researchers successfully identified the most influential risk factors associated with termination of pregnancy. These are
